1.Differentiation of let, const, and var in JavaScript
var, let, and const are used to store values in JavaScript. var is the old way and can be used anywhere in a function  but it can be changed anytime which can cause mistakes. let is better because it only works inside {} where it was made, and while you can change its value, you can’t declare it again in the same place. const is like let but once you set a value, you can’t change it at all. It’s best to use const for values that don’t change and let for ones that do while var is not recommended.

2. Concept of Falsy Values in JavaScript
Falsy values in JavaScript are values that act like false in conditions. Some examples are 0, "" (empty string), and null. If you use if (0), the code won’t run because 0 is falsy. The same happens with if ("") since an empty string means false. null is also falsy, so if (null) won’t work either.
